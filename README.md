# GTtrain

      GaTech CS4400 Project on 2016 Spring Semester.
      Coded in Java, and using mySQL for background server.
      
      The program is only working in computer, not for mobile app/etc
      to search train ticket and buy/change/cancel it.
      It simply checking student e-mail and provides discount to buy tickets too.
      For administrator, few more functions allowed 
      when admin account logged in, and by using SQL,
      user log can be shown up.
      

      Since my SQL understanding was poor at that moment,
      I pretty much hardcoded the functions with Java.

      However, the program itself should not work at this moment,
      since it used gatech server to get/store data but it's only opened for the semester.
