# GTtrain

      GaTech CS4400 Project on 2016 Spring Semester.
      Coded in Java, and using mySQL for background server.

      Since my SQL understanding was poor at that moment,
      I pretty much hardcoded the functions with Java.

      However, the program itself should not work at this moment,
      since it used gatech server to get/store data but it's only opened for the semester.
